    <h1><b>Meta programming</b></h1>
    <p>Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their </p>
    <p>data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise be done at runtime. In many cases, this allows </p>
    <p>programmers to get more done in the same amount of time as they would take to write all the code manually, or it gives </p>
    <p>programs greater flexibility to efficiently handle new situations without recompilation. Or, more simply put: </p>
    <p>Metaprogramming is writing code that writes code during runtime to make your life easier.</p>

    <p>
        Catching "Ghost Methods" and forwarding them onto another method Whilst possibly adding logic around the call.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, You can provide imaginary methods by utilising `method_missing` to parse the incoming message (e.g. `get_name`, `get_age`) and to delegate off to another method such as `get(:data_type)` where `:data_type` is `:name` or `:age`.

  super # if we don't find a match then we'll call the top level `BasicObject#method_missing`
end

# If (after analysis) you discover a performance issue with using `method_missing`
# you can utilise the "Dynamic Method" technique to create a real method after
# the message has been received by `method_missing` the first time.

    <h1><a name="describe">Blank Slate</a></h1>
    <p>
        CPrevents issues when using "Dynamic Proxies"
    </p>
    <p>
        e.g. user calls a method that exists higher up the inheritance chain so your `method_missing` doesn't fire because the method does exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        To work around this issue, make sure your class starts with a "Blank Slate" So you remove any methods you don't want to appear at all in the inheritance chain by using `undef_method` (there is also `remove_method` which doesn't remove the named method from the inheritance chain but just the current class, but that doesn't help us fix the "Dynamic Proxy" scenario so we use `undef_method` instead).
    </p>
    <p>
        For "Dynamic Proxy" we use the parent `method_missing` so we keep that, we also might use `respond_to?` so we keep that (although you can remove it if you don't). Also the `__` in the below regex pattern is to prevent Ruby from displaying a warning about removing 'reserved' methods such as `__id__` and `__send__
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">

    undef_method m unless m.to_s.match?(/^__|method_missing|respond_to?/)

    <h1><a name="describe">Kernel Method</a></h1>
    <p>
        Add a method that gives the illusion it's a language keyword But really it's just added to the `Kernel` module which all other objects inherit from. At the top level of a Ruby program `self` is == `main`.
    </p>
    <p>
        `self.class` == `Object` and the `Kernel` sits above it in the hierarchy. You can see this by running the following code:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <p class="spec-title spec-correct">Meta</p>
{% highlight ruby %}

class Foo; end
Foo.ancestors # => [Foo, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

# So we can see we can add what looks to be a language provided feature like so:
module Kernel
  def foobar
    puts "I'm not a language keyword, I'm just a fake"
  end
end

# Now from any where in our program we can call
foobar # => I'm not a language keyword, I'm just a fake

    <h1><a name="describe">Flattening the Scope (aka Nested Lexical Scopes)</a></h1>
    <p>
        Where you change the code in such a way that it's easier for you to pass variables through "Scope Gates". A scope gate is any block, where normally when you enter its scope the variables outside of it become unreachable. This happens in: Class definitions, Module definitions, Method definitions I'm not sure what the real life examples are of this, but if you ever wonder why some code does the following, then maybe it was that they wanted to flatten the scope so they could more easily pass around variables. I guess it's better to do it this way than to define a global variable?
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following code we want to access `my_var` from inside the method (inner scope gate) that's inside the class (outer scope gate).
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <p class="spec-title spec-correct">Meta</p>
{% highlight ruby %}

my_var = 'abc'
class OuterScopeGate
  puts my_var

  def inner_scope_gate
    puts my_var
  end
end

# We fix this by flattening the code into method calls (method *calls* aren't scope gates)
# So we turn the class keyword into a method call using `Class.new`
# We also turn the method inside the class from a keyword into a method call using `define_method`
my_var = 'abc'
MyClass = Class.new do
  puts "Here is 'my_var' inside my class definition: #{my_var}"

  define_method :my_method do
    puts "Here is 'my_var' inside my class instance method: #{my_var}"
  end
end # => Here is 'my_var' inside my class definition: abc
MyClass.new.my_method # => Here is 'my_var' inside my class instance method: abc

    <h1><a name="describe">Class Macros</a></h1>
    <p>
        Class Macros are just regular class methods that are only used in a class definition e.g. not used from a new instance of the class (only at the time the class is defined)
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is an example of a Class Macro that alerts users of a publically available class that the methods they've been using are now deprecated and they should use the renamed version.
    </p>
    <p>
        It uses "Dynamic Method" to help performance by creating the old methods again and delegating off to the new methods (rather than using `method_missing` which can be quite slow as it has to spend time looking up the inheritance chain)
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">

class Foo
  def get_a

  end

  end

  def self.deprecate(old_method, new_method)
