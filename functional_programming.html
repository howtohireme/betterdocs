    <h1><b>Functional programming</b></h1>
    <p>Using a language in a functional style implies you have access to a few key features that listed below.</p>
    <p>Immutable values: once a “variable” is set, it cannot be changed. In Ruby, this means you effectively have to treat variables like constants.</p>
    <p>No side-effects: when passed a given value, a function must always return the same result. This goes hand in hand with having immutable values; a function can never take a value and change it, as this would be causing a side-effect that is tangential to returning a result.</p>
    <p>Higher-order functions: these are functions that allow functions as arguments, or use functions as the return value. This is, arguably, one of the most critical features of any functional language.</p>
    <p>Currying: enabled by higher-order functions, currying is transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes one argument. This goes hand in hand with partial function application, which is transforming a multi-argument function into a function that takes less arguments then it did originally.</p>
    <p>Recursion: looping by calling a function from within itself. When you don’t have access to mutable data, recursion is used to build up and chain data construction. This is because looping is not a functional concept, as it requires variables to be passed around to store the state of the loop at a given time.</p>
    <p>Lazy-evaluation, or delayed-evaluation: delaying processing of values until the moment when it is actually needed. If, as an example, you have some code that generated list of Fibonacci numbers with lazy-evaluation enabled, this would not actually be processed and calculated until one of the values in the result was required by another function, such as puts.</p>

    <p>You can see that this function computes the result only using its arguments.</p>

    <h1><a name="describe">Partial applying and curryng</a></h1>
    <p>
      Let’s first understand what these two different applications of functions are. Partial function aplication is calling a function with some number of arguments, in order to get a function back that will take that many less arguments. Currying is taking a function that takes n arguments, and splitting it into n functions that take one argument.
    </p>
    <div class="code-block">
      <p class="spec-title spec-correct">Partial applying and curryng</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
  # In order to give you a clearer idea of what each of these two things will
  # do a function, let’s take an example Proc:
  proc { |x, y, z| x + y + z }

  # Partial application of this function would return, if we passed in the first
  # two arguments, the following nested Procs:
  proc { |x, y| proc { |z| x + y + z } }

  # On the other hand, currying this function would return the following nested
  # Procs:
  proc { |x| proc { |y| proc { |z| x + y + z } } }
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>

    <p>
      .curry returns a curried proc. If the optional arity argument is given, it determines the number of arguments. A curried proc receives some arguments. If a sufficient number of arguments are supplied, it passes the supplied arguments to the original proc and returns the result. Otherwise, returns another curried proc that takes the rest of arguments.
