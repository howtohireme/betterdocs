# Contributions

First of all, thanks for taking out time to contribute here! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ruby fundamental repository. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [opensource@howtohireme.ru](mailto:opensource@howtohireme.ru).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner-friendly`, `good first issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* `beginner-friendly`, `first-timers-only`, `good first issue` - issues which requires usually a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* `help-wanted` - issues which requires a bit more involvement than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Issues

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

* Check if the issue has not already been reported.
* Check if the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code (a.k.a. `master`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
  
## Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

* Fork the project.
* Use a `<issue number>_<issue short description>` branch name format to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Write `[#<issue number>] <good commit message>` commit name format.
* Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Open a pull request that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
